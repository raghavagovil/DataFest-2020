With the COVID-19 pandemic upon us, the general attitudes of people as a whole have shifted drastically as we have pivoted towards a new reality. As peoples’ attitudes reflect their actions, we think it is important to study those attitudes as they could inform of events that have great societal ramifications. A potent example of an extremely significant event coming up upon us in the United States is the 2020 Presidential Election. We wish to analyze data to gauge the potential impact of changing attitudes during the COVID-19 pandemic on the coming election.
The data we have collected includes:

### Google Mobility Data: 
This dataset, provided by Google, highlights the percent change in visits to grocery and pharmacy stores, parks, transit stations, residences, retail and recreation, and workspaces within a given geographic area. 

### Pew Survey Data: 
The Pew Research Center is a “nonpartisan fact tank” that “conducts public opinion polling, demographic research, content analysis and other data-driven social science research.” From March 19th to March 24th, the Pew Research Center conducted a nationwide survey to gather opinions and attitudes of the people of America on factors related to COVID-19, including their take on the political aspects of the pandemic. 

### Google Trends Data: 
This data represents the trends in people’s Google Searches. It gives us the popularity of given search queries in geographic regions given a specific time frame. We have gathered Google Trends for the terms “lockdown”, “stay at home” and “quarantine” for the last 3 months for the 50 states in the US. The trends from this data was then tied back to the previous Pew and mobility data to tie our story up together. 

In the US population, we find from the Pew dataset that the majority of Republicans think that President Donald Trump has done a good or excellent job in responding to the COVID-19 outbreak, while the majority of Democrats think that Trump has done a fair or poor job. We also find that more Republicans nationally would feel comfortable going to a polling place to vote than Democrats. We also find that Democrats generally consider the virus more of a crisis than Republicans.

We drilled down into two Census divisions of the country - Pacific and East South Central - that are, respectively, the most dominantly Democratic and Republican divisions of the country (according to Pew). In the Pacific and East South Central regions, we see that the trends regarding outlook on Trump’s handling of the virus and going to polling booths are similar to the national trends. We also see through Google trends that the Pacific region is more concerned with COVID than the East South Central region, and that the East South Central region had more mobility during lockdown than the Pacific region.

Based on our research using the above data, we concluded that the Democrats face a much more uphill battle in the upcoming Presidential Elections than the Republicans.
